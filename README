A ctypes python interface for some fast execution of gsw functions.

Currently implemented:

rho: in-situ density from C,t,p,lat,lon
SA:  absolute salinity from C,t,p,lat,lon
CT:  conservative temperature from C,t,p,lat,lon

INSTALL

First download and install the gsw_C library from http://www.teos-10.org/software.htm.

* unzip the zip file
* cd gsw_c_v3.5
* make library
* sudo cp libgswteos-10.so /usr/local/lib
* sudo ln -sf /usr/local/lib/libgswteos-10.so.3 /usr/local/lib/libgswteos-10.so
* sudo cp gswteos-10.h /usr/local/include
* sudo ldconfig /usr/local/lib


Then make the gsw_vector library

* cd gsw_vector
* adjust, if necessary, the path to libgswteos include files.
* make && sudo make install

Build the python module

python3 setup.py build && sudo python3 setup.py install

If you receive and error that the gsw_vector dynamic library cannot be
loaded, then the /usr/local/lib path is not included in ldconfig. To
that end create a file local.conf in /etc/ld.so.conf.d with the
content
/usr/local/lib

The file local.conf could also be named differently, however.
